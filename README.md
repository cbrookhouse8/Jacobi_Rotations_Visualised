## Synopsis

This program visualises the progress of an algorithm that Diagonalizes a Symmetric Matrix. 

The grid represents an initial symmetric matrix that by successive Jacobi rotations is gradually transformed into a Diagonal matrix.

This process finds the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues of the initial Symmetric Matrix.

## Motivation

* I thought that the Jacobi algorithm would lend itself to visualisation given that it at all stages preserves the symmetry of the symmetric matrix, whilst transforming it through successive rotations.
* To better understand how a PCA algorithm might work (because PCA amounts to a diagonalization of the (symmetric) covariance matrix)
* To produce some kind of algorithmic art
